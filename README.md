# Reweighting for fake data studies

This repository allows one to perform a reweighting analysis on any given Nuisance file. 

## Prerequisites

### Environment

If you DO have conda installed, simply add `--use-conda` at the end of any command including snakemake.
If you DO NOT have conda installed, you should first create a virtual environment with the following command :
```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```
and then install the necessary librairies with :
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Please use the `snakemake` commands WITHOUT `--use-conda` at the end

### Input files

After cloning the repository, one should first download the input files. For example, the Neut and Genie files used in previous analysis were taken from:
- https://portal.nersc.gov/project/nuisance/MC_IOP_review/GENIEv3_G18_10b_00_000/, especially : T2KND_FHC_numu_H2O_GENIEv3_G18_10b_00_000_1M_0000_NUISFLAT.root
- https://portal.nersc.gov/project/nuisance/MC_IOP_review/NEUT562/, especially : T2KND_FHC_numu_H2O_NEUT562_1M_0000_NUISFLAT.root

After downloading the needed files, one should place them in the appropriate directory (ex : `GENIE_file` and `NEUT_file` directory, but feel free to create your own directory). 
Then, open the file named `config.yaml`, and change the `neut_file` and `genie_file` path to match the relative path of the files you want to reweight. Please note that the original distribution will be the one given to `neut_file` and the target will be the one given to `genie_file`.

Commands to download the files:
```
mkdir GENIE_file
wget https://portal.nersc.gov/project/nuisance/MC_IOP_review/GENIEv3_G18_10b_00_000/T2KND_FHC_numu_H2O_GENIEv3_G18_10b_00_000_1M_0000_NUISFLAT.root GENIE_file/

mkdir NEUT_file
wget https://portal.nersc.gov/project/nuisance/MC_IOP_review/GENIEv3_G18_10b_00_000/T2KND_FHC_numu_H2O_GENIEv3_G18_10b_00_000_1M_0000_NUISFLAT.root NEUT_file/
```

## Quick Start

```
snakemake saved_figures/snakemake_test/5D/metrics.json --cores 8 --use-conda
```

## Configuration

Also in the `config.yaml` file, you can change several parameters for your analysis : 

In the `analysis` section, you can specify:
- the interaction mode number (default is 1 for CCQE), 
- the PDG number of the interacting neutrino (default is 14 for muon neutrino)
- the train_percentage which defines the amount of data that go into your training sample (default is 0.4, should be between 0 and 1)
- the val_percentage which defines the amount of data that go into your validation sample (default is 0.4, should be between 0 and 1)
Please make sure that the sum of the percentages does not exceed 1. (The amount of datat going into the test sample is automatically computed)

In the 'features'/'parameters_interest' section, you can specifiy the parameters that you want to use to train the different methods on.
Please pick from the following list : ["Enu_true", "ELep", "CosLep", "Q2", "q0", "q3", "W", "Eav"].

In the 'models'/'model_list' section, you can specifiy the models that you want to use.
Please pick from the following list : ['binning', 'NN', 'GBR', 'XGB'].

In the 'dimensions'/'dim' section, you can specify the dimension of the parameters of interest. This is purely for folder creation, so that each combination of parameters can be created.
Default is a number, but you may give any value as argument.

In the 'output'/'tag' you can specify the tag that you want to give to your analysis. The files will be created in the different folders in subfolder with the given tag.
For example this can include parts of the name of the reweighted distributions. 
Please use strings.

[The following steps are hacky and will be removed when the grid search feature will be ready]
///
In the 'set_hyperparameters' directory, create a sub-directory with the same tag that you gave in the 'config.yaml' file.
Inside this directory, create a file named 'hyperparameters.json'. This file should contain a dictionnary, containing a dictionnary of the set of hyperparameters you want the different method to be built with. 
For example : 
{"binning": {"n_bins" : 10, "n_neighs" : 0},
"NN" : {"n_layers" : 2, "n_neurons" : 15, "epochs" : 100, "batch_size" : 4096, "activation_function" : "tanh"},
"GBR" : {"n_estimators": 110, "learning_rate": 0.03, "max_depth": 4, "min_samples_leaf": 90, "loss_regularization":3},
"XGB" : {"n_estimators" : 80, "gamma" : 0, "max_depth" : 3, "learning_rate" : 0.075, "subsample" : 1, "early_stopping_rounds" : 10}}

Please give as many sets as different method you want to train.
///

Once all the above steps are completed, you are ready to run the analysis.
To run a complete analysis, including samples creation, model training, metrics evaluation and plotting, enter the following command in your terminal: 

```
snakemake saved_figures/snakemake_test/{Dim}D/metrics.json --cores 8  (--use-conda  (only if you use conda))
```

where {Dim} should be replaced by the number of dimensions given in the 'dimensions'/'dim' section of the 'config.yaml' file.
Once finished, you can explore the different 'saved' folders containing the samples, models, metrics and plots.

Congrats, you ran your first analysis !
